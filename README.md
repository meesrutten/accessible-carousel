# Carousel
I made this carousel with `a[href="#image-NUMBER"]` and `:target`.

In the CSS I've added `scroll-behaviour: smooth`

`button` elements will be added via JavaScript to add another way to navigate in the carousel.

Works without JavaScript and partially without CSS (things may look off)

Works from IE9
